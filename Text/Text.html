<h1>COULOMB'S LAW:</h1>
<h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We Know that there are two kinds of charges,namely, positive and negative charges. The charges on an electron is assumed to be negative and charge on a proton is positive. Moreover, we also know that like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. Now we investigate the quantitative nature of these forces.<ins><i>The first measurement of the force between electric charges was made in 1784 AD by Charles Coulomb, a French military engineer.</i></ins> On the basaic of these measurements, he deduced a law known as Coulomb's law. It states that:</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><b><q>The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the <strong><i>product</i></strong> of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the <strong><i>square</i></strong> of the distance between them.</q></b></p>
